    <h2>Description</h2>

   
     <p>Falafel, or ta'ameya as they call it in Egypt, is an all-time favorite street food. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas</p>

    <p>However, in Egypt, they make it with dried fava beans. They are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.</p>
